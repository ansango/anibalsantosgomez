  "p1": "Hello! My name is An√≠bal, I was born in Salamanca, Spain, where I grew up and currently reside. I am dedicated to technology, I am Mid Frontend Developer, in other words I am specialized in the development of visual interfaces for the web.",
  "p2": "I started in the world of photography, back in 2002, when I was still a teenager, and the digital world had just arrived to try to finish with chemistry photography.",
  "p3": "The first camera I had in my hands was an Olympus C-200, a small digital compact camera, with almost no manual settings and a resolution of 2 megapixels.",
  "p4": "Shortly after I had my first DSLR camera, a famous Canon EOS 350D, with which I spent many years and with which I lived many experiences.",
  "p5": "Skateboarding and suburban music like punk and hardcore, have allowed me to grow as a creator and observe the world in a different way. Both spaces have allowed me not only to learn some techniques, but also to see life as a creative atmosphere where technique is not everything.",
  "p6": "My first contact with analog photography was when I bought second hand the camera with which I usually work, a Canon EOS 50E. With it I shot my first film, a Fujifilm C-200, in 2013.",
  "p7": "Nowadays I hardly do digital photography and I'm focused on analog photography. Personally I would say that it is a very reflexive process, which allows me to imagine things in a different way. I see the digital world as a spiral of too fast consumption and this is the reason that has made me approach the process of creating chemical photography.",
